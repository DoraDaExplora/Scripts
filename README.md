# Scripts
A collection of my scripts an automatizations.
Feel free to use them yourself, but be careful and read the code before using.

## Contents

### Python

Python scripts that make my life a bit easier. Safe to say these scripts are not that good, 'cause I've just started learning python.

### Node

Same goes for the Node.js, but the thing is that I'm much more profound with JS, so these may be much better in terms of quality.
